### Tutu WSDL to PHP generator example app

This is an example app

#### TODO List

At the moment code just works but there is a lot of stuff to do.
We must change the way that classes are generated and refactor 
many other things. Also we must build new tests.
```
1. Url config option
2. Save schemas from url option
2. Avoid usage of symfony (used only in config)
3. Code generation templates and improvements 
4. Refactor the way classes must be generated (from structures)
5. Extend classes and attributes types
6. Add documentation and tests
```
